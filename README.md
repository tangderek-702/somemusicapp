# Music Palette

This project is an iOS app that is for music lovers who are searching for new songs or playlists! 
You can swipe right on artist you like and left on artist you don't like, and Music Palette will make a whole new music playlist (palette) for you.
We implemented Alex Takahashi's [SwipeSelectorKit](https://github.com/alextakahashi/SwipeSelectorKit) to help create the swiping component.

Note: Latest version of the app is currently on newMusicBranch.
